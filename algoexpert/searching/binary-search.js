/* Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer.
The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to nd if the target number is contained in the array and
 return its index if it is, otherwise -1.
 Sample input: [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73], 33
 Sample output: 3
