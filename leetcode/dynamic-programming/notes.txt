1. tabulation or memoization way
2. tabulation means bottom up dynamic programming. starts from base to required
3. Memoization means top down dynamic programming
4. overlapping sub problems
5. Tabulation: iterative approach and takes O(n) subproblems from the smallest to the largest.
   RECURSION: Top down: We start from answer, go to the base case and then go back
   MEMOIZATION: TOP DOWN:  avoids redundant calls done in recursion reducing time complexity
   TABULATION IS: Bottom up: We start from the base case and we try to go to the required answer

6. Identify: Choices + optimal
7. try to make recurrence relation something like f(i) = get the required data  with constraint from index [0... i]. It's like
checking the sub problem till you reach index [0...n]
